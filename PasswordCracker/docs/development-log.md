# Password Cracker Development Log

## Project Overview
**Duration:** 3 sessions
**Status:** Complete - Core functionality implemented
**Learning Focus:** Dictionary attacks, hash algorithms, Python development

---

## Session 1: Foundation and Hash Generation
**Focus:** Project setup and MD5 hash understanding

### Completed Tasks
1. **Project Structure Creation**
   - Created `password_cracker/` directory structure
   - Set up documentation framework
   - Established version control approach

2. **MD5 Hash Generation Implementation**
   ```python
   test_password = "password123"
   test_hash = hashlib.md5(test_password.encode()).hexdigest()
   # Result: 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
   ```

3. **Multiple Test Hash Creation**
   - Implemented `create_test_hashes()` function
   - Generated 5 target hashes for comprehensive testing
   - Verified deterministic hash generation behavior

### Technical Challenges Encountered
- **Character Encoding Requirement:** MD5 requires byte input, not Unicode strings
- **Solution:** Used `.encode('utf-8')` method for proper string-to-bytes conversion
- **Learning Outcome:** Understanding of cryptographic function input requirements

### Key Insights
- MD5 produces consistent 32-character hexadecimal output regardless of input length
- Hash functions are mathematically one-way operations
- Dictionary attacks exploit human password selection patterns

### Code Quality Achievements
- Descriptive function names and comprehensive docstrings
- Proper main guard pattern implementation
- Professional code organization and structure

## Session 2: Dictionary Attack Engine
**Focus:** Core cracking algorithm and file processing

### Completed Tasks
1. **Dictionary Attack Function Development**
   ```python
   def crack_single_hash(target_hash, wordlist_file):
       # Systematic password testing against target hash
   ```

2. **File I/O Implementation**
   - Safe file reading with context managers
   - Error handling for missing wordlist files
   - Progress tracking and user feedback systems

3. **Hash Comparison Logic**
   - String processing with `.strip()` for newline removal
   - Direct hash comparison for match detection
   - Attempt counting for performance analysis

### Attack Results Analysis
- **Target Hashes:** 5 test hashes generated
- **Success Rate:** 5/5 (100%)
- **Attack Performance:**
  - password123: 1 attempt
  - 123456: 2 attempts  
  - admin: 4 attempts
  - qwerty: 5 attempts
  - letmein: 6 attempts

### Technical Insights
- Wordlist ordering significantly impacts attack efficiency
- Stream processing prevents memory overflow with large wordlists
- Progress indicators improve user experience during long attacks

## Session 3: Professional Tool Development
**Focus:** Command-line interface and performance optimization

### Completed Tasks
1. **Command-Line Interface Implementation**
   ```python
   python password_cracker.py <target_hash> <wordlist_file>
   ```

2. **Input Validation System**
   - Hash format verification (32 characters, hexadecimal)
   - File existence checking
   - Proper error messages and usage instructions

3. **Performance Measurement Integration**
   - Timing analysis with microsecond precision
   - Speed calculation in attempts per second
   - Professional output formatting

### Performance Results
- **Speed:** 1000+ attempts per second average
- **Duration:** ~0.01 seconds for single hash crack
- **Efficiency:** Memory-optimized stream processing

### Professional Features Added
- Usage instructions and help messages
- Error handling for edge cases
- Dual-mode operation (test mode + CLI mode)
- Professional output formatting

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Core Components
```python
create_test_hashes()        # Generate known MD5 hashes for testing
save_target_hashes()        # Write target hashes to file
create_wordlist()           # Generate attack dictionary
crack_single_hash()         # Main dictionary attack engine
main()                      # Command-line interface handler
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Stream Processing:** File reading line-by-line for memory efficiency
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks for robust operation
- **Progress Tracking:** User feedback during long attack sessions
- **Modular Design:** Separate functions for testing and production use

### Security Considerations Implemented
- Educational purpose documentation
